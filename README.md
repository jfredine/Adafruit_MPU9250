# Adafruit MPU9250

This is a library for the MPU9520 9-DoF accelerometer, gyro, and magnetometer.
It is essentially an MPU6050 (accelerometer and gyro) and AK8963
(magnetometer) combined into a single chip and this library is designed to work
with the [Adafruit Unified Sensor library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Sensor).
It is significantly derived from the
[Adafruit MPU6050](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_MPU6050) library.
